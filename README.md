My solutions for [Advent of Code 2018.](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) 

[Last year I did Advent of Code in Go.](https://github.com/m-r-hunt/aoc2017)

This year I'm doing it mostly in a language I created myself: Nail! Compiler and VM coming soon (hopefully). Note that Nail is very much in development, I put in some hacks to get it ready for AOC2018 and I need to make some changes to the language syntax.

Some days I did in Rust (mostly when it was very convoluted and I wanted static types to help me).

This repo is a cargo project for convenience of running the Rust solutions. E.g. `cargo run --example d9`

Status:
* d1: Nail✅
* d2: Nail✅
* d3: Nail✅
* d4: Nail✅
* d5: Nail✅
* d6: Nail✅
* d7: Nail✅
* d8: Nail✅
* d9: Nail (Part 1 only)⚠️, Rust (both parts)✅
* d10: Need to redo❌
* d11: Nail✅
* d12: Nail (Part 1 only, originally did Part 2 by hand, need to code properly)⚠️
* d13: Rust✅
* d14: Nail (Part 2 is slow)⚠️
* d15: Rust✅
* d16: Rust✅
* d17: Rust✅
* d18: Rust✅
* d19: Rust✅
* d20: Rust✅
* d21: Rust✅
* d22: Rust✅
* d23: Rust (Part 1 only, need to redo Part 2)⚠️
