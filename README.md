# aoc2018
My solutions for Advent of Code 2018. [Last year I did Advent of Code in Go.](https://github.com/m-r-hunt/aoc2017)

This year I'm doing it mostly in a language I created myself: Nail! Compiler and VM coming soon (hopefully). Some days I did in Rust (mostly when it was very convoluted and I wanted static types to help me).

This repo is a cargo project for convenience of running the Rust solutions. E.g. `cargo run --example d9`

Status:
* d1: Nail
* d2: Nail
* d3: Nail
* d4: Need to redo
* d5: Nail
* d6: Nail
* d7: Nail
* d8: Nail
* d9: Nail (part 1 only), Rust (both parts)
* d10: Rust
* d11: Nail
* d12: Nail
* d13: Rust
* d14: Nail (Part 2 is slow)
* d15: Rust
* d16: Rust
